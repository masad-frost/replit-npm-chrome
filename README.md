# replit-npm-chrome
Chrome extension that adds a repl.it link to npm packages' pages.

Note: If a package doesn't work on the browser (only supports node), it won't work. Hopefully [the node environment on repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/nodejs) adds support for npm packages, so we can do something about that. I'll probably add an environment selector pop-up or something.

Will probably do something similar on PyPi soon.
